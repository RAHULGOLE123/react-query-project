## 📚 Topics Covered with Short Explanations

- **What is TanStack Query and its advantages**  
  A data-fetching library for React that simplifies async state, caching, background sync, etc.

- **Installing TanStack Query**  
  Install via npm: `npm install @tanstack/react-query`.

- **Adding `queryClient` and `QueryClientProvider`**  
  Enables React Query in the app by wrapping it with a provider.

- **Fetching API data using `useQuery`**  
  Use `useQuery` to fetch, cache, and update server data easily.

- **Managing loading and error states**  
  Use `isLoading`, `error`, and `data` for simple state handling.

- **React Query DevTools**  
  Debug your queries visually like a Chrome devtool panel.

- **Garbage collection**  
  Automatically removes old cache data to free up memory.

- **Managing stale time**  
  Defines how long data stays fresh before it’s considered stale.

- **Polling for real-time behavior**  
  Auto-refetch data at intervals to mimic real-time updates.

- **Using `queryKeys` effectively**  
  Unique keys that identify and manage each query.

- **Implementing pagination**  
  Load data in pages using `pageParam` and `getNextPageParam`.

- **Deleting data with `useMutation`**  
  Perform delete requests and refetch queries on success.

- **Updating data with `useMutation`**  
  Update server data and sync cache automatically.

- **Infinite scrolling**  
  Load more items on scroll with `useInfiniteQuery`.

- **Intersection Observer with infinite scroll**  
  Detect when user reaches end of list and load next page.

- **Hosting on Hostinger**  
  Build (`npm run build`) and deploy the `dist/` folder to Hostinger.
